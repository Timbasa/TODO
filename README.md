# Things to Do From 6/19/2019 to 7/6/2019

## Read papers in ICML: 

two best papers and seven honorable Mentions. And other papers associated with time series and online learning.

Two best papers:

http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/locatello19a/locatello19a.pdf

- [ ] Rates of Convergence for Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03571.pdf

Seven Honorable mentions:

- [ ] Analogies Explained: Towards Understanding Word Embeddings
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09813.pdf

- [ ] SATNet: Bridging deep learning and logical reasoning using a differentiable satisfiability solver
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12149.pdf

- [ ] A Tail-Index Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Noise in Deep Neural Networks
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06053.pdf

- [ ] Towards A Unified Analysis of Random Fourier Features
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09178.pdf

- [ ] Amortized Monte Carlo Integration
http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/udl-camera-ready/UDL-12.pdf

- [ ] Social Influence as Intrinsic Motivation for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning

- [ ] Stochastic Beams and Where to Find Them: The Gumbel-Top-k Trick for Sampling Sequences Without Replacement
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06059.pdf

Read these papers, and understand how these papers organized, what the problems they are trying to solve, how their results can help for our further research. 
Read the papers associated with time series and online learning. Figure out what they are studying and how to use it in our project (in two ways: robust and accuracy).

- [ ] Write blog showing what I learn in ICML 2019.

## Studyng GluonTS. Using their datasets in pytorch and compare the results with Gluon.

- [ ] use Gluon to run the experiments

- [ ] use pytorch and datasets in Gluon to run the experiments

## Learn how to create the library that stores the benchmarks and best models in pytorch for online learning.

- [ ] create the library to store the benchmarks and best models

## NEXT TARGET CONFERENCE:

AAAI-20： https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/

July 15 – August 30, 2019: Authors register on the AAAI web site

August 30, 2019: Electronic abstracts due at 11:59 PM UTC-10 (midnight Hawaii)

September 5, 2019: Electronic papers due at 11:59 PM UTC-10 (midnight Hawaii)

October 10-13, 2019: Author Feedback Window (5:00pm PDT – 5:00pm PDT)

November 10, 2019: Notification of acceptance or rejection

November 21, 2019: Camera-ready copy due at 5:00 PM PDT (California time)

## Prepare for the feedback from NeurIPS.

- [ ] Find more accuracy result using different quantiles, and plot the prediction with true data.

- [ ] Try to use a simple model to test our algorithm, like MLP, to see how results look like.
